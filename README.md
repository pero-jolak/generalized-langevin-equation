# generalized-langevin-equation
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook code for:

- Estimating the truncated power-law memory kernel with Prony series.
- Simulating a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) using a Markovian embedding.
- Estimating the frequency response, the real and imaginary part of the complex susceptibility.
