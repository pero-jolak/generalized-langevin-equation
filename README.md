This repository contains a Jupyter notebook code and numerical simulation data for:

- Estimating the truncated power-law memory kernel with Prony series (GLE_simulation.ipynb)
- Simulating a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) using a Markovian embedding (GLE_simulation.ipynb)
- Estimating the frequency response, the real and imaginary part of the complex susceptibility (GLE_simulation.ipynb)
- Plotting the figures (plot_figures.ipynb)
